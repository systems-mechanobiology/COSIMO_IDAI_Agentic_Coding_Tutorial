## Part 1: A Brief History of AI Coding Assistants: From Autocomplete to Agents

**Two Converging Paths:**

1.  **From Autocomplete:** `Tab-Complete` → Copilot → "Ghost text"
2.  **From Chatbots:** ChatGPT → Copy/Paste → Integrated Chat
3.  **The Merger:** Coding Agents

---

## Path 1: Autocomplete (The "Inline" Path)

*   **Start:** IDE suggestions (variable names)
*   **Evolution:** GitHub Copilot (2021) — context-aware next tokens
*   **Limitation:**
    *   Reactive, not proactive
    *   Cannot run or test its own code
    *   "Thinks" in small context windows (file-level)

---

## Path 2: Chatbots (The "Conversational" Path)

*   **Interaction:** Copy-paste into ChatGPT/Claude window
*   **Limitation:**
    *   **The "Clipboard Wall":** You must manually move code back and forth
    *   **Zero-shot:** If it fails, *you* paste the error back
    *   **Context:** Limited to what you paste

---

## The Convergence: Coding Agents

*   **Interaction:** Agent has **terminal**/**ide** and **file access**
*   **The Paradigm Shift:**
    *   Old: REPL (Read-Eval-Print) controlled by **Human**
    *   New: **Plan-Act-Observe** controlled by **Agent**
*   **The Loop:**
    1.  **Plan:** "Calculate pairwise distances between atoms"
    2.  **Act:** Writes script using appropriate libraries
    3.  **Observe:** Sees `MemoryError`
    4.  **Debugs and Refines:** "Switch to sparse matrix"
*   **Why it matters:** Closes the feedback loop *without human intervention*

---

## Key Insight: Be Specific about the *Goal*, not the *Syntax*

::: {.prompt-box}
❌ Write a for loop that iterates through the list and calculates the mean
:::

::: {.prompt-box}
✅ Implement an SIR epidemic model with transmission rate β and recovery rate γ
:::

The agent knows how to write loops. **You** know what an SIR model is.

**Rule of Thumb:**
- **Don't** micromanage the code (syntax)
- **Do** micromanage the output (science/style)

---



## Tools We'll Use Today

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **VS Code / Cursor / Antigravity** | IDE with agent integration |
| **Gemini / Claude** | The underlying LLM |
| **Python** | Our target language |

::: {.notes}
These tools are accessible to anyone with basic coding familiarity.
:::

---

## Part 2: From Blank Repo to Prototype

We'll build a simple epidemiological simulation **from scratch**.

::: {.warning-box}
**Live Demo Ahead!** 🎬  

:::

## The Challenge: Our Goal Today

**Remember the pandemic?** The famous **R number**?

We want to simulate that spread.

$$ \text{Susceptible} \rightarrow \text{Infected} \rightarrow \text{Recovered} $$

**The Mission:**

1.  **Build** this simulation code from scratch.
2.  **Visualise** the outbreak.
3.  **Analyse** it with data.

*...without writing the code ourselves.*

---

## The Math Behind the Model

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
We want to go from **blank file** to **working simulation** of a pandemic (SIR model).

- **S**: Susceptible
- **I**: Infected
- **R**: Recovered

We will build this *live* to demonstrate the power of **Coding Agents**.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta S I \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

**The "R Number" ($R_0$):**

$$ R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} $$

-   If $R_0 > 1$: Epidemic grows 📈
-   If $R_0 < 1$: Epidemic dies out 📉
:::

---

## Prompt 1: Project Initialization

::: {.prompt-box}
Create a Python project structure for simulating an SIR epidemic model. Include a main simulation script, a module for the model equations, and a visualization script. Set out the structure without implementing any details.
:::

Let's see what the agent produces...

---

## Prompt 2: Implement the Model

::: {.prompt-box}
Implement the SIR model differential equations. The model should track Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered populations over time. Use scipy.integrate.odeint for integration.
:::

---

## Prompt 3: Visualization
::: {.prompt-box}
Create a visualization that shows S, I, R curves over time. Add proper labels, legend, and a title. Use a clean, publication-ready style.
:::

---

## Prompt 4: Explain & Review
::: {.prompt-box}
Look at the plot. Explain what is happening. What is the peak infected count and when does it occur?
:::

*Key Insight:* The agent acts as a **tutor** and **reviewer**.

## Talking to AI with Scientific Intent

**Effective prompting strategies:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **State the scientific goal** first, not the implementation
2. **Use domain terminology** — the model understands SIR, ODE, etc.
3. **Provide constraints** — "use scipy" or "make it efficient for large N"
4. **Iterate** — refine based on initial output
:::

---

## Part 3: Fitting Real Data

::: {.warning-box}
**Live Demo!** 🎬  
We'll fit our SIR model to real pandemic data from Italy's first wave.
:::

---

## The Data: Italy, February–May 2020

- **Source:** Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 Repository
- **Period:** First wave (before vaccines, clear lockdown signal)
- **Key event:** National lockdown on **March 9, 2020**

*Can our simple SIR model capture a real pandemic?*

---

## Prompt 1: Load Real Data

::: {.prompt-box}
Load the COVID-19 data for Italy from `data/covid_italy_first_wave.csv`. Plot active infections over time. Add a vertical line for the lockdown date (March 9).
:::

---

## Prompt 2: Fit the SIR Model

::: {.prompt-box}
Create a function that fits our SIR model to the Italy data. Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to find the best β and γ. Print the estimated R0.
:::

---

## Prompt 3: Visualize and Critique

::: {.prompt-box}
Plot the best-fit model against the real data. Critically evaluate: where does the simple SIR assumption break down?
:::

*Key insight:* The lockdown changed β — our constant-β model can't capture that!

---

## Interpret the Fitted Parameters

::: {.prompt-box}
Based on the optimized β and γ: What is R₀? How does it compare to published estimates (2.5-3.5)? What is the implied infection duration (1/γ)?
:::

*Teaching point:* R₀ depends on context; not an intrinsic property of the virus alone.

---

## Part 4: Going Beyond Basic SIR

::: {.incremental}
- **4.1 Time-Varying β:** Model the lockdown effect with piecewise transmission
- **4.2 Country Comparison:** Compare Italy vs South Korea response strategies
- **4.3 Uncertainty:** Bootstrap confidence intervals for R₀
:::

---

## Prompt: Time-Varying Transmission

::: {.prompt-box}
Modify the SIR model to use β_pre before lockdown and β_post after. Fit both values and compare R₀ before and after March 9.
:::

*This captures what our constant-β model missed!*

---

## Prompt: Country Comparison

::: {.prompt-box}
Repeat the SIR fitting for South Korea. Create a side-by-side comparison with Italy. Which country had lower R₀? What strategies might explain this?
:::

*South Korea used aggressive testing vs Italy's lockdown approach.*

---

## Prompt: Uncertainty Quantification

::: {.prompt-box}
Use bootstrap resampling to estimate 95% confidence intervals for R₀. Visualize the uncertainty as a shaded band around the model curve.
:::

*Point estimates without uncertainty can be misleading!**

---

## Part 5: Let the AI Write the Report

::: {.prompt-box}
"Write a scientific report summarizing our COVID-19 SIR analysis. Include Introduction, Methods, Results with figures, Discussion of limitations, and Conclusion."
:::

---

## Prompt: Peer Review

::: {.prompt-box}
"Act as a peer reviewer. Evaluate the report for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Provide constructive feedback."
:::

*The AI can both write AND review!*

---

## Part 6: Outlook (2026)

::: {.incremental}
- **2022**: Copy-pasting fragments
- **2026**: Orchestrating **Agents**
- **New Skills**: Managing **MCP Servers**, defining Agent Skills
:::

## Coming Up Next

::: {.warning-box}
**In Two Weeks:** "Building Custom Agent Skills"
(Connecting agents to your own databases and tools)
:::

**Today:** We focus on the *practical application*.

---

## Wrap-Up: What We Covered

::: {.incremental}
- ✅ Coding agents as scientific collaborators
- ✅ Prompting with *scientific intent*, not syntax
- ✅ Building simulation code from scratch
- ✅ Fitting models to real COVID-19 data
- ✅ AI-assisted scientific report writing
:::

## Discussion Points

| Topic | Teaching Point |
|-------|----------------|
| **Model-data mismatch** | SIR is too simple for COVID-19; useful for intuition |
| **Data quality** | "Recovered" poorly reported; active cases are estimates |
| **Interventions** | Constant β fails when behavior changes |
| **R₀ interpretation** | Depends on context, not intrinsic to virus |
| **Extensions** | SEIR, age structure, spatial models |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **You bring domain expertise** — the AI brings coding fluency
2. **Iterate quickly** — first draft is rarely perfect
3. **Trust but verify** — always review the generated code
4. **Scientific problems need scientific prompts**

# COSIMO-IDAI Series {.center}

## Accelerating Research with Agentic AI

**Overall Purpose:**
AI is now integral to science, but **rapid evolution** and **opaque failure modes** make reliable usage difficult.

**This series aims to:**

::: {.incremental}
- Equip researchers with **practical, model-agnostic skills**
- Develop **critical literacy** on failure modes
- Promote **best practices** for reproducibility & validation
- Create a shared **institutional culture** around AI science
:::

::: {.notes}
Target audience: PhD students, postdocs, PIs, and RSEs across all disciplines.

# The Challenge {.center}

## Our Goal Today: The SIR Model

**Remember the pandemic?** The famous **R number**?

We want to simulate that spread.

$$ \text{Susceptible} \rightarrow \text{Infected} \rightarrow \text{Recovered} $$

**The Mission:**

1.  **Build** this simulation code from scratch.
2.  **Visualise** the outbreak.
3.  **Analyse** it with data.

*...without writing the code ourselves.*

---

# Part 1: The Evolution of AI Coding {.center}

## The Math Behind the Model

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
We want to go from **blank file** to **working simulation** of a pandemic (SIR model).

- **S**: Susceptible
- **I**: Infected
- **R**: Recovered

We will build this *live* to demonstrate the power of **Coding Agents**.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta S I \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I
\end{aligned}
$$

## 1.5. From Autocomplete to Agents

**Two Converging Paths:**

1.  **From Autocomplete:** `Tab-Complete` → Copilot → "Ghost text"
2.  **From Chatbots:** ChatGPT → Copy/Paste → Integrated Chat
3.  **The Merger:** Coding Agents

---

## Path 1: Autocomplete (The "Inline" Path)

*   **Start:** IDE suggestions (variable names)
*   **Evolution:** GitHub Copilot (2021) — context-aware next tokens
*   **Limitation:**
    *   Reactive, not proactive
    *   Cannot run or test its own code
    *   "Thinks" in small context windows (file-level)

---

## Path 2: Chatbots (The "Conversational" Path)

*   **Interaction:** Copy-paste into ChatGPT/Claude window
*   **Limitation:**
    *   **The "Clipboard Wall":** You must manually move code back and forth
    *   **Zero-shot:** If it fails, *you* paste the error back
    *   **Context:** Limited to what you paste

---

## The Convergence: Coding Agents

*   **Interaction:** Agent has **terminal** and **file access**
*   **The Loop:**
    1.  **Write** code
    2.  **Run** code
    3.  **Read Error** (if any)
    4.  **Fix** code
*   **Context:** Reads the entire repository (Project awareness)

## The AI Landscape (2026): Models & Tools

| Tier | Description | Models (2026) |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Thinking** | Reliable daily coding | GPT-5.2 Think, DeepSeek R2, Claude 4.5 Sonnet |
| **Pro** | Maths & Derivations | GPT-5.2 Pro, Gemini DeepThink, Claude 4.5 Opus |
| **Open Weights** | Local / Private / Cheap | Llama 4, Mistral Large, DeepSeek V3 |
| **Frameworks** | The UI that *acts* | Cursor, Copilot Agent, Cline, Claude Code |

---

## Key Insight: Scientific Intent, Not Syntax

::: {.prompt-box}
❌ "Write a for loop that iterates through the list and calculates the mean"
:::

::: {.prompt-box}
✅ "Implement an SIR epidemic model with transmission rate β and recovery rate γ"
:::

The agent knows how to write loops. **You** know what an SIR model is.

---

## Tools We'll Use Today

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **VS Code / Cursor** | IDE with agent integration |
| **Gemini / Claude** | The underlying LLM |
| **Python** | Our target language |

::: {.notes}
These tools are accessible to anyone with basic coding familiarity.
:::

# Part 2: Live Coding — Simulation {.center}

## From Blank Repo to Working Prototype

We'll build a simple epidemiological simulation **from scratch**.

::: {.warning-box}
**Live Demo Ahead!** 🎬  
Open `prompts/02_simulation.md` for the prompts we'll use.
:::

---

## Prompt 1: Project Initialization

::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a Python project structure for simulating an SIR epidemic model. Include a main simulation script, a module for the model equations, and a visualization script."
:::

Let's see what the agent produces...

---

## Prompt 2: Implement the Model

::: {.prompt-box}
"Implement the SIR model differential equations. The model should track Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered populations over time. Use scipy.integrate.odeint for integration."
:::

---

## Prompt 3: Visualization
::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a visualization that shows S, I, R curves over time. Add proper labels, legend, and a title. Use a clean, publication-ready style."
:::

---

## Prompt 4: Explain & Review
::: {.prompt-box}
"Look at the plot. Explain what is happening. What is the peak infected count and when does it occur?"
:::

*Key Insight:* The agent acts as a **tutor** and **reviewer**.

## Talking to AI with Scientific Intent

**Effective prompting strategies:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **State the scientific goal** first, not the implementation
2. **Use domain terminology** — the model understands SIR, ODE, etc.
3. **Provide constraints** — "use scipy" or "make it efficient for large N"
4. **Iterate** — refine based on initial output
:::

---

# Part 3: Live Coding — Data Analysis {.center}

## Building an Analysis Pipeline

::: {.warning-box}
**Live Demo!** 🎬  
Open `prompts/03_analysis.md` for the prompts we'll use.
:::

---

## Prompt 1: Load Real Data

::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a synthetic dataset representing an outbreak (Cases: [15, 60, ...]). Load this into a pandas DataFrame and plot it as scatter points."
:::

---

## Prompt 2: Fit Simulation to Data

::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a function that runs the SIR simulation and estimates the best `beta` and `gamma` parameters that minimize the squared error with the real data."
:::

---

## Prompt 3: Critique the Fit

::: {.prompt-box}
"Critically evaluate the final plot. Does the model capture the peak correctly? Where does the simple SIR assumption fail?"
:::

---

# Part 4: Outlook (2026) {.center}

## Software Engineering is Changing

::: {.incremental}
- **2022**: Copy-pasting fragments
- **2026**: Orchestrating **Agents**
- **New Skills**: Managing **MCP Servers**, defining Agent Skills
:::

## Coming Up Next

::: {.warning-box}
**In Two Weeks:** "Building Custom Agent Skills"
(Connecting agents to your own databases and tools)
:::

**Today:** We focus on the *practical application*.

---

# Wrap-Up {.center}

## What We Covered

::: {.incremental}
- ✅ Coding agents as scientific collaborators
- ✅ Prompting with *scientific intent*, not syntax
- ✅ Building simulation code from scratch
- ✅ Creating data analysis pipelines
- ✅ Debugging AI-generated code
:::

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **You bring domain expertise** — the AI brings coding fluency
2. **Iterate quickly** — first draft is rarely perfect
3. **Trust but verify** — always review the generated code
4. **Scientific problems need scientific prompts**

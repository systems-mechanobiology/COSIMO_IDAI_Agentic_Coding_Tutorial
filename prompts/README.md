# Prompts Library

This directory contains the prompts for the live coding demonstrations during the seminar.

## How to Use

1. **During the presentation**, when you reach a live coding section, open the corresponding file
2. **Copy the prompt** and paste it into your AI coding agent
3. **Narrate** what you're doing as the agent generates code
4. **Iterate** if the output needs refinement

## Files

| File | Content | Seminar Section |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `01_setup.md` | Initial setup and orientation | Part 1: Intro |
| `02_simulation.md` | Building simulation code | Part 2: Simulation |
| `03_analysis.md` | Data analysis pipeline | Part 3: Analysis |

## Tips for Live Demo

1. **Read prompts aloud** as you type/paste them
2. **Pause after pasting** to let the audience see the prompt
3. **Narrate the agent's actions** as it generates code
4. **Have backup prompts** in case a prompt needs refinement
5. **Expect errors** — debugging is part of the demo!

## Customizing Prompts

Feel free to modify these prompts based on:
- Your specific research domain
- Audience expertise level
- Available time

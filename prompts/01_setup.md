## Prompt 1.3: Basic Scaffolding

Show project initialization.

```
Create a basic Python project structure for a scientific simulation.
Include:

## Notes for Presenter

These prompts are intentionally simple to warm up the audience and show basic agent capabilities before diving into scientific content.

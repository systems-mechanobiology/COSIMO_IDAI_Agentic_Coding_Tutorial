# Examples

This directory will contain code generated during the live demo.

Before the seminar, this directory is empty or contains minimal scaffolding.
After the seminar, it will contain the working code produced by the AI agent.

## Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Clear any previous demo code
- [ ] Ensure `data/` directory has sample data (if using analysis prompts)
- [ ] Verify Python environment is set up

## Expected Outputs

After running through the prompts, this directory should contain:

### From Simulation Demo
- `sir_model.py` — Model equations
- `simulate.py` — Main simulation script
- `visualize.py` — Plotting code

### From Analysis Demo
- `analysis.py` — Data loading and statistics
- `figures.py` — Publication figure generation

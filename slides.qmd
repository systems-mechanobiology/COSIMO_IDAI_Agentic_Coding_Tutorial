## Agentic Coding: From Idea to Proof-of-Concept

::: {.incremental}
- **Brief overview** of coding agents
- **Live demonstration** of addressing a *scientific* problem using AI
- **Example domains**: simulation code, data analysis pipeline
:::

::: {.notes}
Welcome everyone. Today we'll see how AI coding agents can accelerate research.

# Part 1: What Are Coding Agents? {.center}

## The Evolution of AI-Assisted Coding

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Autocomplete**

- Suggests next few tokens
- Context-limited
- You drive everything
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Agentic Coding**

- Understands your *intent*
- Reads/writes multiple files
- Runs commands, debugs errors
- Acts as a collaborator

## Key Insight: Scientific Intent, Not Syntax

::: {.prompt-box}
❌ "Write a for loop that iterates through the list and calculates the mean"
:::

::: {.prompt-box}
✅ "Implement an SIR epidemic model with transmission rate β and recovery rate γ"
:::

The agent knows how to write loops. **You** know what an SIR model is.

## Tools We'll Use Today

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **VS Code / Cursor** | IDE with agent integration |
| **Gemini / Claude** | The underlying LLM |
| **Python** | Our target language |

::: {.notes}
These tools are accessible to anyone with basic coding familiarity.

# Part 2: Live Coding — Simulation {.center}

## From Blank Repo to Working Prototype

We'll build a simple epidemiological simulation **from scratch**.

::: {.warning-box}
**Live Demo Ahead!** 🎬  
Open `prompts/02_simulation.md` for the prompts we'll use.
:::

---

## Prompt 1: Project Initialization

::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a Python project structure for simulating an SIR epidemic model. Include a main simulation script, a module for the model equations, and a visualization script."
:::

Let's see what the agent produces...

---

## Prompt 2: Implement the Model

::: {.prompt-box}
"Implement the SIR model differential equations. The model should track Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered populations over time. Use scipy.integrate.odeint for integration."
:::

---

## Prompt 3: Visualization

::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a visualization that shows S, I, R curves over time. Add proper labels, legend, and a title. Use a clean, publication-ready style."
:::

---

## Talking to AI with Scientific Intent

**Effective prompting strategies:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **State the scientific goal** first, not the implementation
2. **Use domain terminology** — the model understands SIR, ODE, etc.
3. **Provide constraints** — "use scipy" or "make it efficient for large N"
4. **Iterate** — refine based on initial output
:::

---

# Part 3: Live Coding — Data Analysis {.center}

## Building an Analysis Pipeline

::: {.warning-box}
**Live Demo!** 🎬  
Open `prompts/03_analysis.md` for the prompts we'll use.
:::

---

## Prompt 1: Load and Explore Data

::: {.prompt-box}
"Load the experimental data from data/measurements.csv. Show me the first few rows, data types, and basic statistics. Identify any missing values or anomalies."
:::

---

## Prompt 2: Statistical Analysis

::: {.prompt-box}
"Perform a statistical comparison between the control and treatment groups. Use an appropriate test based on the data distribution. Report the test statistic, p-value, and effect size."
:::

---

## Prompt 3: Publication Figure

::: {.prompt-box}
"Create a publication-quality figure comparing the two groups. Include error bars, individual data points, and significance annotations. Save as both PNG and PDF at 300 DPI."
:::

# Part 4: Debugging AI-Generated Code {.center}

## When Things Go Wrong

AI-generated code is not always correct. Common issues:

::: {.incremental}
- **Hallucinated APIs** — functions that don't exist
- **Logic errors** — correct syntax, wrong algorithm
- **Version mismatches** — code for older library versions
:::

---

## Debugging Strategy

::: {.prompt-box}
"This code throws [paste error message]. The issue seems to be with [your hypothesis]. Can you fix it?"
:::

**Key principles:**

1. **Share the error message** — the agent can read stack traces
2. **Share your hypothesis** — even if wrong, it helps
3. **Test incrementally** — don't ask for everything at once

---

## Example: Fixing a Real Error

::: {.prompt-box}
"When I run the simulation with β=0.3 and γ=0.1, I get negative population values. This violates conservation of population. Please check the ODE implementation and fix the issue."
:::

# Wrap-Up {.center}

## What We Covered

::: {.incremental}
- ✅ Coding agents as scientific collaborators
- ✅ Prompting with *scientific intent*, not syntax
- ✅ Building simulation code from scratch
- ✅ Creating data analysis pipelines
- ✅ Debugging AI-generated code
:::

## Key Takeaways

1. **You bring domain expertise** — the AI brings coding fluency
2. **Iterate quickly** — first draft is rarely perfect
3. **Trust but verify** — always review the generated code
4. **Scientific problems need scientific prompts**
